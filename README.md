# Rod_first_project_GenAI

### My project submission to request confirmation of meeting project criteria. 

#### New submission after review input:

Left one Jupyter Notebook with retraining for the baseline assessment, model training and saving. Then a second Jupyter Notebook to retrieve the saved model to perform inference and confirm that the changes were saved and provide a better result than baseline per the fine-tuning using LoRA. Also adding the saved model.


#### Original submission notes:

Kept having connection failed so had to work locally using my GPU to be able to train and evaluate.

Results can further improve with more epochs yet consider it enough to prove the learning objective.

References to my work include the GenAI content and the help from GenAI assistant and Chatgpt.
